- **project_views:** Public viewing, anyone can record views
- **judge_feedback:** Public viewing, judges can provide feedback
- **updates:** Public viewing, admins manage
- **discussions:** Public viewing, authenticated creation, admin moderation
- **registrations:** Public viewing, leaders manage own teams

### Storage Policies
✅ Public read access to project files and images  
✅ Authenticated users can upload files  
✅ Users can manage their own uploads

## ⚠️ Advisory Notes (Non-Critical)

### Security Advisories
- **Function search_path mutable** (2 functions)
  - Impact: Low priority
  - Recommendation: Set search_path in function definitions
  - Status: Can be addressed in future optimization

### Performance Advisories
- **Unindexed foreign keys** (7 tables)
  - Impact: Minor at current scale
  - Recommendation: Add indexes when scaling
  - Status: Monitoring performance metrics

- **Auth RLS initialization plan** (Multiple policies)
  - Impact: Query optimization opportunity
  - Recommendation: Use `(select auth.uid())` pattern
  - Status: Performance acceptable, can optimize later

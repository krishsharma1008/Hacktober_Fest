# üîç Supabase Status Report

## ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Database has the tables (`project_likes`, `project_views`)
- Tables are properly configured with RLS
- Foreign key constraints are in place
- Using Supabase MCP, I can see the tables exist

## ‚ùå What's Not Working:
- PostgREST API cannot see the tables
- Error: "Could not find the table 'public.project_likes' in the schema cache"
- NOTIFY pgrst signals are not triggering a reload

## üîß Root Cause:
This is a **PostgREST schema cache synchronization issue**. The database and PostgREST are out of sync.

## üéØ Solution:
You need to **manually restart the PostgREST API service** from the Supabase Dashboard.

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vfkdyrypekweyqhfqkko
2. Click **Settings** (left sidebar)
3. Click **API**
4. Find the **"Restart Server"** or **"Restart API"** button
5. Click it
6. **Wait 2 full minutes**
7. Then refresh your app

This should force PostgREST to reload the schema from the database.

---

## Alternative: Wait for Automatic Reload
PostgREST may automatically reload the schema on its next restart cycle (could be hours).

---

## Current State:
- Code has been restored to use the like/view features
- Once PostgREST sees the tables, everything will work
- No code changes needed - it's purely an infrastructure issue

---

**Next Step: Restart the API service manually in Supabase Dashboard**

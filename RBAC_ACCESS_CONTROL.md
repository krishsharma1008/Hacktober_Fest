# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Reference

## Overview

Your Hacktoberfest application implements a three-tier role-based access control system:
- **üë§ User** (Participant) - Default role for all registered users
- **üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge** - Can evaluate and score projects
- **üëë Admin** - Full system access

All access controls are enforced at the **database level** using Row Level Security (RLS), making them impossible to bypass from the frontend.

---

## üîê Security Architecture

### Database-Level Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on ALL tables
- **SECURITY DEFINER functions** for safe operations
- **Foreign key constraints** maintain data integrity
- **UNIQUE constraints** prevent duplicates
- **Automatic role assignment** on user signup

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up ‚Üí `auth.users` entry created
2. Trigger fires ‚Üí `handle_new_user()` function executes
3. Profile created in `profiles` table
4. Default 'user' role assigned in `user_roles` table
5. User can now interact with the system

## üë§ USER Role (Participants)

### Projects Module

**‚úÖ Can:**
- View all submitted projects (`SELECT` on projects)
- Create new projects (`INSERT` with `created_by = auth.uid()`)
- Edit their own projects (`UPDATE WHERE created_by = auth.uid()`)
- View project details and statistics
- Like/unlike projects (authenticated only)
- View project likes and views counts

**‚ùå Cannot:**
- Edit other users' projects
- Delete any projects (admin only)
- Change project status to 'approved'
- Bulk update projects

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Anyone can view projects
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view projects"
  ON projects FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Users can create projects (must be their own)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create projects"
  ON projects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = created_by);

-- Users can only update their own projects
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own projects"
  ON projects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (created_by = auth.uid() OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));
```

### Likes Module

**‚úÖ Can:**
- Like any project (creates entry in `project_likes`)
- Unlike their own likes (deletes from `project_likes`)
- View all project likes (public metric)
- See their own like status on projects

**‚ùå Cannot:**
- Like the same project twice (UNIQUE constraint prevents this)
- Delete other users' likes
- Manipulate like counts directly

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Anyone can view likes
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view likes"
  ON project_likes FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Authenticated users can like projects
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert likes"
  ON project_likes FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own likes"
  ON project_likes FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Views Module

CREATE POLICY "Judges can insert feedback"
  ON judge_feedback FOR INSERT TO authenticated

## üëë ADMIN Role

### Inherits ALL User + Judge Permissions, PLUS:

### Full System Access

**‚úÖ Can:**
- **Projects:** Edit ANY project, Delete ANY project, Approve/reject submissions
- **Users:** View all user roles, Assign/modify user roles (including admin, judge)
- **Judge Feedback:** Edit ANY feedback, Delete feedback, Override scores

-- Admins can delete projects
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete projects"
  ON projects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

  USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

-- Admins can manage discussions
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage discussions"
  ON discussions FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Functions

### `has_role(user_id UUID, role app_role) ‚Üí BOOLEAN`

Checks if a user has a specific role.

```sql
-- Check if user is admin
SELECT has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin');

-- Check if user is judge
SELECT has_role(auth.uid(), 'judge');

-- Used in RLS policies
USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'))
```

### `get_user_role(user_id UUID) ‚Üí app_role`

Returns user's highest role (admin > judge > user).

```sql
-- Get current user's role
SELECT get_user_role(auth.uid());

-- Result: 'admin', 'judge', or 'user'
```

### `toggle_project_like(project_id UUID) ‚Üí (liked BOOLEAN, total_likes BIGINT)`

Securely toggles like status for a project.

```sql
-- Like a project
SELECT * FROM toggle_project_like('project-uuid');

-- Returns: {liked: true, total_likes: 42}
-- or: {liked: false, total_likes: 41} if unliking
```

**Security Features:**
- Requires authentication (throws error if not logged in)
- Atomic operation (no race conditions)
- Automatically updates `projects.likes` counter
- Enforces UNIQUE constraint (one like per user per project)

### `record_project_view(project_id UUID, ip_address TEXT) ‚Üí BIGINT`

Records a unique view for a project.

```sql
-- Record view (authenticated user)
SELECT record_project_view('project-uuid');

-- Record view (anonymous with IP)
SELECT record_project_view('project-uuid', '192.168.1.1');

-- Returns: total view count
```

**Security Features:**
- Prevents duplicate views from same user/IP
- Works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Automatically updates `projects.views` counter
- Silent failure (doesn't block on errors)

---

## üß™ Testing Access Controls

### Test 1: User Permissions

```sql
-- Sign in as regular user
-- Try to like a project
SELECT * FROM toggle_project_like('some-project-id');
-- ‚úÖ Should work

-- Try to edit someone else's project
UPDATE projects SET title = 'Hacked' WHERE created_by != auth.uid();
-- ‚ùå Should fail (0 rows updated due to RLS)

-- Try to create judge feedback
INSERT INTO judge_feedback (project_id, judge_id, score)
VALUES ('some-project-id', auth.uid(), 10);
-- ‚ùå Should fail (RLS policy blocks)
```

### Test 2: Judge Permissions

```sql
-- Sign in as judge
-- Try to submit feedback
INSERT INTO judge_feedback (project_id, judge_id, score, comment)
VALUES ('some-project-id', auth.uid(), 8, 'Great work!');
-- ‚úÖ Should work

-- Try to delete a project
DELETE FROM projects WHERE id = 'some-project-id';
-- ‚ùå Should fail (only admins can delete)
```

### Test 3: Admin Permissions

```sql
-- Sign in as admin
-- Try to edit any project
UPDATE projects SET status = 'approved' WHERE id = 'some-project-id';
-- ‚úÖ Should work

-- Try to assign judge role
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('some-user-id', 'judge');
-- ‚úÖ Should work

-- Try to create announcement
INSERT INTO updates (title, content, created_by)
VALUES ('New Event!', 'Important update', auth.uid());
-- ‚úÖ Should work
```

---

## üîÑ Role Management

### Assigning Roles (Admin Only)

```sql
-- Make user a judge
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('user-uuid', 'judge')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;

-- Make user an admin
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('user-uuid', 'admin')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;

-- Remove judge role
DELETE FROM user_roles
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid' AND role = 'judge';
```

### Checking User Roles

```sql
-- Get all roles for a user
SELECT role FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';

-- Get highest role
SELECT get_user_role('user-uuid');

-- Check if user is admin
SELECT has_role('user-uuid', 'admin');
```

### Multiple Roles

Users can have multiple roles:
- A user can be BOTH 'user' and 'judge'
- A user can be BOTH 'user' and 'admin'
- `get_user_role()` returns the HIGHEST role: admin > judge > user

## üö® Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Always use `has_role()` in RLS policies
- Use SECURITY DEFINER for sensitive functions
- Enforce UNIQUE constraints on critical tables
- Test with different user roles
- Log admin actions for audit trail
- Use service_role key only in backend/scripts
- Keep anon key in frontend (it's safe - RLS protects data)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Never expose service_role key to frontend
- Don't trust frontend validation only
- Don't bypass RLS in application code
- Don't hardcode user IDs
- Don't use direct SQL in frontend
- Don't assume roles - always check with `has_role()`

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After applying migrations:

- [ ] RLS enabled on all 9 tables
- [ ] 20+ RLS policies created
- [ ] 5 security functions exist
- [ ] app_role enum has 3 values
- [ ] UNIQUE constraints on critical tables
- [ ] Foreign keys properly set up
- [ ] Storage buckets created
- [ ] Storage policies applied
- [ ] Trigger for new users working
- [ ] Default 'user' role assigned on signup

# 🔴 CRITICAL: Supabase PostgREST Cache Issue

## Summary
Tables `project_likes` and `project_views` are successfully created in the database via Supabase MCP, but the PostgREST API layer cannot see them due to a schema cache synchronization issue.

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created Tables via Supabase MCP
- Applied migration `create_project_likes_and_views`
- Applied migration `create_like_and_view_functions`
- Tables confirmed to exist in database
- RLS policies configured
- Functions created with proper permissions

### 2. Verified Database State
```bash
✅ project_likes table exists
✅ project_views table exists
✅ RLS enabled on both
✅ Foreign keys to projects and auth.users
✅ Indexes created
✅ Functions created
```

### 3. PostgREST Cannot See Tables
```bash
❌ API Error: PGRST205
❌ "Could not find the table 'public.project_likes' in the schema cache"
❌ Even after 60+ seconds wait time
❌ NOTIFY signals don't trigger reload
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**PostgREST schema cache is not auto-reloading** when new tables are added via migrations.

This is a known issue with Supabase's PostgREST layer where:
1. Database schema changes don't automatically propagate to PostgREST
2. NOTIFY signals may not reach the PostgREST process
3. Only a manual API restart forces schema reload

---

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION

You **MUST** manually restart the PostgREST API service:

### Steps:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vfkdyrypekweyqhfqkko
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon in left sidebar)
3. Click **API** tab
4. Find button: **"Restart Server"** or **"Restart API"** or **"Restart PostgREST"**
5. Click it
6. **Wait 2 full minutes** (120 seconds - set a timer!)
7. Run test command below

### Test Command:
```bash
cd /Users/krishsharma/Desktop/Hacktober_fest && node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabase = createClient('https://vfkdyrypekweyqhfqkko.supabase.co', 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InZma2R5cnlwZWt3ZXlxaGZxa2tvIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjA3NTMyOTIsImV4cCI6MjA3NjMyOTI5Mn0.sjDrUAnR0CKwkrzi3yLAwB0V4o2qvth65n7aOowH334');
(async () => {
  const { error } = await supabase.from('project_likes').select('*').limit(1);
  console.log(error ? '❌ Still cached: ' + error.code : '✅ SUCCESS! Working now!');
  if (!error) console.log('🎉 Refresh browser: http://localhost:8084 (Cmd+Shift+R)');
})();
"
```

### Expected Result:
```
✅ SUCCESS! Working now!
🎉 Refresh browser: http://localhost:8084 (Cmd+Shift+R)
```

## 📊 Current State

### Database (via MCP):
- ✅ 9 tables total
- ✅ project_likes exists
- ✅ project_views exists
- ✅ All constraints and indexes in place

### PostgREST API:
- ❌ Only sees 7 tables
- ❌ Missing: project_likes, project_views
- ❌ Returns PGRST205 error
- ⏳ **Needs manual restart**

### Frontend Code:
- ✅ Ready to use like/view features
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ⏳ Waiting for API to see tables

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions (If Restart Doesn't Work)

### Option 1: Contact Supabase Support
Create a support ticket at https://supabase.com/dashboard/support with:
- Project ID: vfkdyrypekweyqhfqkko
- Issue: PostgREST won't reload schema after migrations
- Request: Manual schema cache refresh

### Option 2: Use Supabase CLI
If you have Supabase CLI installed:
```bash
supabase db remote restart
```

### Option 3: Wait for Auto-Reload
PostgREST may auto-reload on next deployment cycle (could be hours/days)

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
1. Test command shows "✅ SUCCESS!"
2. Browser console has NO 404 errors
3. You can like/unlike projects
4. View counts increment
5. Edit Project works without errors

## 🎯 Next Step

**GO TO SUPABASE DASHBOARD AND RESTART THE API NOW** 🚀

Then wait 2 minutes and run the test command.

This will work. The tables are ready. PostgREST just needs to see them.

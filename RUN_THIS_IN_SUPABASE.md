## ❓ Troubleshooting

If you still see errors after running:

1. **Wait 30 seconds** - Supabase needs to refresh its cache
2. **Hard refresh your browser** - Clear the old API responses
3. **Check the SQL output** - Look for any red error messages
4. **Verify tables exist** - Go to "Table Editor" and look for:
   - `project_likes`
   - `project_views`

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If errors persist, check:
- You're running the SQL in the correct project (`vfkdyrypekweyqhfqkko`)
- The `projects` table exists (required for foreign keys)
- You have admin access to the Supabase project

# üö® CRITICAL: Schema Cache Issue Detected

## The Problem
The SQL ran, but Supabase's API cache hasn't refreshed yet. The tables exist in the database but the REST API doesn't know about them.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Tables Exist
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: `vfkdyrypekweyqhfqkko`
3. Click "SQL Editor" ‚Üí "New Query"
4. Copy and paste: **`VERIFY_AND_REFRESH.sql`**
5. Click "Run"
6. You should see ‚úÖ EXISTS for all tables and functions

### Step 2: Restart the API (CRITICAL)
This forces Supabase to reload the schema cache.

**Option A: Via Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Settings** (left sidebar)
2. Click **API** section
3. Find the **"Restart API"** button
4. Click it and wait 10-15 seconds

**Option B: Via SQL (Already done)**
The VERIFY_AND_REFRESH.sql sends a reload signal, but manual restart is more reliable.

### Step 3: Test Your App
1. Wait 30 seconds after API restart
2. Go to: http://localhost:8084
3. Hard refresh: **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+F5** (Windows)
4. Click "Edit Project" or try to like a project
5. Check browser console - NO MORE 404 ERRORS! ‚úÖ

## üîç Why This Happens

Supabase uses PostgREST, which caches the database schema for performance. When you create new tables/functions, the cache doesn't automatically update. You need to either:
- Restart the API service, OR
- Send a NOTIFY signal (less reliable)

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results After API Restart

### In Browser Console:
- ‚úÖ No "404 Not Found" errors
- ‚úÖ No "Could not find table" errors
- ‚úÖ project_likes queries work
- ‚úÖ project_views queries work
- ‚úÖ toggle_project_like() works
- ‚úÖ record_project_view() works

### In Your App:
- ‚úÖ Like button works
- ‚úÖ View counter increments
- ‚úÖ Edit Project button works
- ‚úÖ No error toasts

## üéØ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Ran COMPLETE_FIX.sql (you did this ‚úÖ)
- [ ] Ran VERIFY_AND_REFRESH.sql (do this now)
- [ ] Restarted API in Supabase Dashboard (CRITICAL - do this!)
- [ ] Waited 30 seconds
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser
- [ ] Tested like/view functionality

## üìû Still Not Working?

If after API restart you still see errors:

1. **Check Table Editor**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in Supabase
   - Verify you see `project_likes` and `project_views` tables
   - If missing, re-run COMPLETE_FIX.sql

2. **Check Database Logs**
   - Go to "Logs" ‚Üí "Postgres Logs"
   - Look for any errors when running the SQL

3. **Check API Logs**
   - Go to "Logs" ‚Üí "API Logs"  
   - Look for schema cache refresh messages

4. **Nuclear Option**
   - Re-run COMPLETE_FIX.sql
   - Restart API
   - Wait 1 full minute
   - Clear browser cache completely
   - Restart your dev server

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- Browser console is clean (no 404s)
- You can like/unlike projects
- View counts increment
- Edit Project opens without errors
- All project interactions work smoothly

**The API restart is the KEY step. Don't skip it!** üîë

================================================================================

TASK: Supabase Project Migration and Interactive Likes/Views Implementation

RATIONALE:
Migrate from old Supabase project (vfkdyrypekweyqhfqkko) to new project 
(tujfuymkzuzvuacnqjos) and implement interactive likes (user-specific toggle) 
and views (unique per-user tracking) functionality for project gallery.

PHASE 1: SUPABASE PROJECT MIGRATION
================================================================================

1. Environment Variables Update
   - File: .env
   - Changed VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID to "tujfuymkzuzvuacnqjos"
   - Updated VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY with new project's anon key
   - Updated VITE_SUPABASE_URL to "https://tujfuymkzuzvuacnqjos.supabase.co"
   
2. Database Schema Migration Files Created
   a) APPLY_ALL_MIGRATIONS.sql (Combined migration file)
      - Location: supabase/migrations/APPLY_ALL_MIGRATIONS.sql
      - Contains all 3 migrations in one file for easy application
      - Uses IF NOT EXISTS and DO blocks for idempotent execution
      - Includes all tables, RLS policies, functions, and storage setup
   
   b) 20251018000000_add_likes_views_tracking.sql (New migration)
      - Location: supabase/migrations/20251018000000_add_likes_views_tracking.sql
      - Creates project_likes table (project_id, user_id, UNIQUE constraint)
      - Creates project_views table (project_id, user_id, ip_address)
      - Implements RLS policies for both tables
      - Adds toggle_project_like() function for atomic like/unlike operations
      - Adds record_project_view() function for unique view tracking
   
   c) MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md
      - Location: supabase/MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md
      - Step-by-step guide for applying migrations via Supabase Dashboard
      - Troubleshooting tips and verification steps
      - Note: MCP Supabase server lacks DDL permissions, manual application required

3. Database Schema Overview
   Tables Created:
   - profiles: User profile information
   - user_roles: User role management (user/admin/judge)
   - projects: Main projects table with likes/views counters
   - project_likes: User-specific like tracking (NEW)
   - project_views: Unique view tracking per user/IP (NEW)
   - judge_feedback: Judge scoring and comments
   - updates: System announcements
   - discussions: Community discussions
   - registrations: Team registration data
   
   Functions Created:
   - toggle_project_like(p_project_id UUID): Toggle like status, returns liked boolean
   - record_project_view(p_project_id UUID, p_ip_address TEXT): Record unique view
   - has_role(_user_id UUID, _role app_role): Check user role
   - get_user_role(_user_id UUID): Get user's highest role
   
   Storage Buckets:
   - project-files: Public bucket for project files
   - project-images: Public bucket for project images

PHASE 2: FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

1. TypeScript Types Update
   - File: src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
   - Added complete type definitions for all database tables
   - Defined Row, Insert, and Update types for each table
   - Added function signatures for toggle_project_like and record_project_view
   - Added app_role enum type ('user' | 'admin' | 'judge')
   
2. Project Interactions Hook
   - File: src/hooks/use-project-interactions.ts (NEW)
   - Custom hook for managing likes and views
   - Features:
     * userLiked: Query to check if current user liked the project
     * toggleLike: Mutation to toggle like status (shows toast notifications)
     * recordView: Mutation to record project view (silent fail)
     * isTogglingLike: Loading state for like button
   - Uses React Query for caching and automatic refetching
   - Requires authentication for likes, shows toast if not logged in
   - Optimistic UI updates via query invalidation

3. ProjectGalleryTab Component Updates
   - File: src/components/tabs/ProjectGalleryTab.tsx
   - Added ProjectLikeButton sub-component:
     * Displays interactive heart icon
     * Changes to filled red heart when liked
     * Shows like count
     * Displays tooltip (Like/Unlike/Sign in to like)
     * Disabled state during API calls with visual feedback
   - Integrated useProjectInteractions hook for selected project
   - Added useEffect to record view when modal opens
   - Updated card view (lines 240-246):
     * Replaced static heart icon with ProjectLikeButton component
     * Maintained eye icon for views display
   - Updated modal view (lines 358-377):
     * Interactive heart button with like toggle
     * Visual feedback for liked state (filled red heart)
     * Displays current like and view counts
   - Imported useAuth context for user authentication checks

4. User Experience Enhancements
   - Smooth animations on heart icon (scale effect during toggle)
   - Color transitions (gray → red) on hover and liked state
   - Toast notifications for user feedback:
     * "Project liked!" on successful like
     * "Like removed" on unlike
     * "Please sign in to like projects" for unauthenticated users
     * Error messages for failed operations
   - Disabled state prevents double-clicking during API calls
   - View tracking happens silently in background (no UI disruption)

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

1. Like Toggle Logic:
   - Database function handles atomic operations (prevents race conditions)
   - Checks for existing like, then INSERT or DELETE accordingly
   - Updates projects.likes counter automatically
   - Returns current like status and total like count
   - RLS policies ensure users can only modify their own likes

2. View Tracking Logic:
   - Records unique views per user (authenticated) or IP (anonymous)
   - Prevents duplicate views from same user/IP
   - Updates projects.views counter automatically
   - Silent failure for non-critical functionality
   - RLS allows anyone to insert views (public read access)

3. Query Management:
   - Uses React Query for efficient data fetching
   - Automatic cache invalidation on like/unlike
   - Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
   - Prevents unnecessary refetches with smart query keys

4. Authentication Integration:
   - Leverages existing AuthContext
   - Graceful handling of unauthenticated users
   - Shows appropriate messages based on auth state
   - Allows viewing but not liking when not logged in

MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: Due to MCP Supabase server DDL permission limitations, migrations 
must be applied manually through the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor.

Steps:
1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: tujfuymkzuzvuacnqjos
3. Navigate to: SQL Editor → New Query
4. Open: supabase/migrations/APPLY_ALL_MIGRATIONS.sql
5. Copy entire contents and paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter
7. Verify success and check Table Editor for new tables

See supabase/MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed instructions.

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Database Setup:
   - Verify all tables exist in Supabase dashboard
   - Check RLS policies are active
   - Test functions in SQL Editor
   - Verify storage buckets are created

2. Frontend Testing:
   - Test like toggle as authenticated user
   - Test like attempt as unauthenticated user (should show toast)
   - Verify heart icon fills red when liked
   - Test unlike functionality
   - Verify view counter increments on modal open
   - Check that views don't increment on repeated opens (same user)
   - Test with multiple users to verify like counter updates
   - Verify real-time updates after like/unlike

3. Edge Cases:
   - Rapid clicking on like button (should be prevented by disabled state)
   - Network failures (should show error toast)
   - Concurrent likes from multiple users
   - Anonymous view tracking (when not authenticated)

POTENTIAL FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================

1. Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
2. Like animation effects (heart burst)
3. Display list of users who liked a project
4. View history and analytics
5. Rate limiting for views to prevent abuse
6. Export like/view data for analytics

FILES MODIFIED
================================================================================

New Files:
- supabase/migrations/20251018000000_add_likes_views_tracking.sql
- supabase/migrations/APPLY_ALL_MIGRATIONS.sql
- supabase/MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- src/hooks/use-project-interactions.ts

Modified Files:
- .env (updated Supabase credentials)
- src/integrations/supabase/types.ts (added complete database types)
- src/components/tabs/ProjectGalleryTab.tsx (added interactive likes/views)

DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

No new dependencies added. Uses existing packages:
- @tanstack/react-query (for data fetching)
- @supabase/supabase-js (for database operations)
- sonner (for toast notifications)
- lucide-react (for icons)

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
================================================================================

- New database tables are additive (no breaking changes)
- Existing projects table columns (likes, views) maintained
- Old project data migration not required (fresh start assumed)
- Frontend gracefully handles missing data (defaults to 0)
- All existing functionality preserved

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

1. Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
2. Like deletion restricted to like owner
3. View insertion allowed for everyone (public metric)
4. SECURITY DEFINER functions prevent RLS bypasses
5. Authentication required for liking projects
6. IP-based tracking for anonymous users (privacy-conscious)

PERFORMANCE NOTES
================================================================================

1. Database counters (likes, views) stored in projects table for fast reads
2. React Query caching reduces API calls
3. Optimistic updates provide instant feedback
4. View tracking runs asynchronously (non-blocking)
5. Indexed foreign keys for fast joins

STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
================================================================================

All frontend code implemented and ready for testing once database migrations 
are applied. TypeScript type errors in IDE are due to language server cache 
and will resolve after restart/rebuild.

Next Steps:
1. User applies migrations via Supabase Dashboard
2. Restart development server: npm run dev
3. Test like/view functionality
4. Verify database updates in Supabase dashboard
5. Run security advisor check via Supabase dashboard
